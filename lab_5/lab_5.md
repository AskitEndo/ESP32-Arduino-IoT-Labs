# Program 5: Rotate Servo Motor in Clockwise and Anticlockwise Directions ü§ñ

## Program Description

This program demonstrates how to control a servo motor, rotating it clockwise from 0 to 180 degrees and then counterclockwise from 180 to 0 degrees. The servo motor rotates continuously in these directions with a short pause at each extreme.

## Required Libraries

‚Ä¢ `Servo.h`: This library is used to control the servo motor.

## How the Program Works

1. **Servo Initialization**: The `Servo` library is included, and a `Servo` object (`myServo`) is created to control the servo motor. The servo is attached to pin 9 in the `setup()` function.

2. **Clockwise Rotation**: The servo rotates from 0 to 180 degrees in steps of 1 degree, with a 15-millisecond delay between each step to allow the servo to reach the position.

3. **Pause**: After the clockwise rotation is complete, the servo holds its position for 1 second.

4. **Counterclockwise Rotation**: The servo rotates from 180 to 0 degrees, with a 15-millisecond delay between each step, just like in the clockwise rotation.

5. **Continuous Loop**: The `loop()` function repeats the process, causing the servo to continuously rotate in a clockwise and counterclockwise manner with pauses at each extreme.

## Notes

‚Ä¢ ‚ö° Ensure that the servo motor is connected to a power source that provides sufficient current, as servos can draw significant power.  
‚Ä¢ üñ•Ô∏è The delay between each position ensures smooth motion of the servo motor. You can adjust this value to control the speed of the rotation.
