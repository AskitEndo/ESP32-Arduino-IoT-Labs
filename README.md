## Welcome to My Collection of 12 Hands-On Projects! 🚀

If you’re passionate about electronics, coding, and building exciting IoT projects, you’ve come to the right place! 🤖💡

This series of Arduino and ESP32-based projects is designed to take you step-by-step through building innovative devices and systems. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, these projects will equip you with the skills to create real-world solutions. From controlling LEDs to measuring distance, detecting collisions, and monitoring environmental conditions like temperature and humidity, this series covers it all! 🌡️🌍

Get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into the world of IoT, electronics, and programming with hands-on learning that’s both fun and rewarding! 🔧💻

## 📖 **What You'll Learn** 🤓

In these 12 programs, we explore:

1. 🌟 **Basic LED control** (like blinking and patterns)
2. 🛠️ **Motor control** (e.g., rotating servo motors)
3. 🔘 **Sensor interfacing** (including IR, ultrasonic, and temperature sensors)
4. 🚦 **Traffic light simulation** (get ready for real-world traffic challenges!)
5. 💨 **Distance measuring** (get those ultrasonic sensors working!)
6. 🔊 **Collision detection** (avoid those bumps with IR sensors)
7. 🌡️ **Environment monitoring** (track humidity, temperature, and heat index)

All these projects are built using **Arduino**, **ESP32**, and some cool external sensors and modules. These are just a few examples of the countless possibilities you can achieve with **IoT** (Internet of Things). 🌐

## 📖 **Required Setup** 🧑‍💻

Before we dive into the projects, make sure your **Arduino IDE** is properly set up and ready for action! Here's what you'll need to do:

### 1. **Install Arduino IDE** 💻

Download and install the latest version of the **Arduino IDE** from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### 2. **Set up ESP32 Board** 🔧

- Go to **File > Preferences** in the Arduino IDE and add the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
  ```
  https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
  ```
- Then, go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager** and install **ESP32 by Espressif Systems**.

### 3. **Install Required Libraries** 📚

Some projects may require specific libraries like **DHT Sensor Library** or **Servo Motor Library**. You can install them via **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.

## 🧰 **IoT RPI Dev Kit** 🎉

<p>A special shoutout to the <strong>IoT RPI Dev Kit</strong> that powers these projects! Here’s the kit I used for all these experiments:</p>
